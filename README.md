Minimalist to-do list to incorporate in your terminal workflow. 

## Why?

GUI to-do lists are distracting, moreover often you might not have access to
GUI interfaces and may want to keep track or make small notes in a CLI. 

Modern to-do lists are highly sophisticated, and I often found myself over-organizing
with categories / labels etc. I needed a simple and minimalist way to keep my goals of 
the day in regular view without having to switch screens often.
